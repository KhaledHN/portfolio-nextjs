It can be of different types, including 0/1 knapsack (items are either included entirely or not at all), fractional knapsack (items can be divided), and multiple knapsack (multiple knapsacks with varying capacities). The problem can be solved using dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, branch and bound, or metaheuristic techniques like genetic algorithms. Knapsack problems have practical applications in resource allocation, finance, cloud computing, manufacturing, and more.",
